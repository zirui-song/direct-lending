Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Nature of operations Resolute Forest Products Inc. (with its subsidiaries and affiliates, either individually or collectively, unless otherwise indicated, referred to as Resolute Forest Products, we, our, us, Parent or the Company) is incorporated in Delaware. We are a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers, which are marketed in close to 80 countries. We own or operate over 40 pulp, paper, tissue and wood products facilities in the United States, Canada and South Korea, as well as power generation assets in Canada and the United States. Financial statements Our interim Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) for interim reporting. Under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are normally required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles may be condensed or omitted. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. The results for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 , filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016 . Certain prior period amounts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on total assets. Change in depreciable lives of machinery and equipment We periodically review the estimated economic useful lives of our fixed assets. Based on this review, during the first quarter of 2016, we prospectively changed our estimate of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment to reflect a net increase of estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment were changed to a range of five to 25 years , increasing the weighted-average estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment by two years . The effect of this change in estimate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was to reduce Depreciation and amortization, and increase Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. , and basic and diluted Net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. common shareholders in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows: \n",

      "New accounting pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective or prospective basis as required for each amendment. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, respectively, which further affect the guidance of ASU 2014-09. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. 6 Table of Contents RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces the current expected credit losses model in the estimation of credit losses on financial instruments. This update is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact the presentation of our cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory until the transferred assets are sold to a third party or recovered through use. This update is effective on a modified retrospective approach for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period, we plan to adopt this ASU as of January 1, 2017, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to Deficit in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. The adoption of this accounting guidance will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 2. Acquisition of Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. On November 16, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Atlas Paper), a manufacturer of a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and private-label at-home markets, including virgin and recycled products, covering economy, value and premium grades and operating two tissue mills and a recycling facility in Florida. In 2016, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the purchase price allocation due to a change in our preliminary valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, which is still subject to adjustment during the 12-month measurement period following the acquisition date or upon completion of the final valuation. As a result, we increased Goodwill by $2 million and decreased Fixed assets, net and Amortizable intangible assets, net, each by $1 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 . We are still in the process of evaluating new information relating to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to validate the valuation of certain acquired intangibles assets, which will result in a reallocation of the purchase price. We are presently finalizing the amounts of the reallocation of the purchase price and expect to record a decrease to Amortizable intangible assets, net, which could range from $25 million to $35 million, and a corresponding increase to Goodwill, net of tax of approximately $10 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the fourth quarter of 2016, prior to the completion of the measurement period, as permitted. The amount of Atlas Papers sales and net loss included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations were $23 million and $5 million , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and were $70 million and $11 million , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 . The following unaudited pro forma information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 represents our results of operations as if the acquisition of Atlas Paper had occurred on January 1, 2015. This pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results that would have occurred for the periods presented or that may be expected in the future. \n",

      "2023 Notes We issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) on May 8, 2013. Upon their issuance, the notes were recorded at their fair value of $594 million , which reflected a discount of $6 million that is being amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of 10 Table of Contents RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements the notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6% . Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, until their maturity date of May 15, 2023. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we incurred financing costs of approximately $9 million , which were deferred and recorded as a reduction of the notes. These deferred financing costs are being amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of the notes. The fair value of the 2023 Notes was $522 million and $440 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, and was determined by reference to over-the-counter prices (Level 1). ABL Credit Facility Our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility) has a maturity date of May 22, 2020 and provides an aggregate lender commitment of up to $600 million at any time outstanding, subject to borrowing base availability based on specified advance rates, eligibility criteria and customary reserves. As of September 30, 2016 , we had $376 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility, net of $40 million of borrowings and $29 million of ordinary course letters of credit outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the ABL Credit Facility approximated its carrying value as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). Senior Secured Credit Facility On September 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility) for up to $185 million . The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a term loan of $46 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2025 (Term Loan), a revolving credit facility of up to $139 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2022 (Revolving Credit Facility), and also provides an uncommitted option to increase the Senior Secured Credit Facility by up to $175 million , subject to certain terms and conditions. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a first priority mortgage on the real property of our Calhoun, Tennessee, facility and a first priority security interest on the fixtures and equipment located therein. Interest rates under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are based, at the Companys election, on either a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or a base rate, in each case plus a spread over the index. The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% ; and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1% . The applicable spread over the index fluctuates quarterly based upon the Companys capitalization ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the Companys funded indebtedness to the sum of the Companys funded indebtedness and its net worth. For the Term Loan, the initial applicable spread is 1% for base rate loans and 2% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.875% to 1.5% for base rate loans, and from 1.875% to 2.5% for LIBOR rate loans. For loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the initial applicable spread is 0.625% for base rate loans and 1.625% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.5% to 1.125% for base rate loans, and from 1.5% to 2.125% for LIBOR rate loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was issued by eight lenders within the farm credit system and will be eligible for patronage refunds. Patronage refunds are distributions of profits from lenders in the farm credit system, which are cooperatives that are required to distribute profits to their members. Patronage distributions, which are made in either cash or stock, are received in the year after they were earned. Future refunds will be dependent on future farm credit lender profits, made at the discretion of each farm credit lender. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to pay a fee in respect of unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility equal to 0.325% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 35% of the total revolving commitments, and 0.275% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is greater than 35% of the total revolving commitments. The fee for unutilized commitments will be 0.325% per annum initially. Base rate loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be repaid from time to time at our discretion without premium or penalty. LIBOR rate loans may be repaid from time to time at our discretion, subject to breakage costs, if any. Amounts repaid on the Term Loan may not be subsequently re-borrowed. Principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn, repaid, and redrawn until September 6, 2022. Pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are also required to maintain a capitalization ratio not greater than 45% at all times, available liquidity of not less than $100 million , and a collateral coverage ratio of not less than 1.8 to 1.0 (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence and repayment of indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of liens; (iv) restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries making certain restricted payments; (v) 11 Table of Contents RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations, and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to material indebtedness. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties, and, subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, also contains certain customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016 , we had $89 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $50 million of borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the fair values of the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility approximated their carrying values as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). Capital lease obligation We have a capital lease obligation for a warehouse with a maturity date of December 1, 2017, which can be renewed for 20 years at our option. Minimum monthly payments are determined by an escalatory price clause. Note 9.

This deferred tax charge is amortized, as the underlying assets are consumed or sold to an unrelated party, in Income tax benefit (provision) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 13 Table of Contents RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies Legal matters We become involved in various legal proceedings and other disputes in the normal course of business, including matters related to contracts, commercial disputes, taxes, environmental issues, activists damages, employment and workers compensation claims, Aboriginal claims and other matters. Although the final outcome is subject to many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, we regularly assess the status of the matters and establish provisions (including legal costs expected to be incurred) when we believe an adverse outcome is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Except as described below and for claims that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters outstanding or pending as of September 30, 2016 , will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2015, we modified our U.S. OPEB plan so that unionized participants, upon reaching Medicare eligibility, are provided Medicare coverage via a Medicare Exchange program rather than via a Company-sponsored medical plan. On March 2, 2016, a proposed class action lawsuit ( Reynolds, et al v. Resolute Forest Products Inc., Resolute FP US Inc., Resolute FP US Health and Resolute Welfare Benefit Plan ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of certain Medicare-eligible retirees who were previously unionized employees of our Calhoun, Tennessee; Catawba, South Carolina; and Coosa Pines, Alabama, mills, and their spouses and dependents. The plaintiffs allege that the modifications described above breach the collective bargaining agreements and plan covering the members of the proposed class in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the health care benefits as in effect before January 1, 2015, for the proposed class in the lawsuit. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to defend the action. On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The proposed class action lawsuit is at a preliminary stage and no class has been certified. Accordingly, we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter or to reasonably estimate the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 26, 2015, a countervailing duty petition was filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (Trade Commission) by certain U.S. supercalendered (SC) paper producers requesting the U.S. government to impose countervailing duties on Canadian-origin SC paper exported to the U.S. market. One of our subsidiaries was identified in the petition as being a Canadian exporting producer of SC paper to the U.S. and was selected as a mandatory respondent to be individually investigated by Commerce. On August 3, 2015, Commerce assigned a preliminary subsidy rate of 2.04% to our SC paper produced at our Canadian mills. On October 15, 2015, Commerce issued a final determination and increased the subsidy rate applicable to our Canadian-produced SC paper to 17.87% . In December 2015, the Trade Commission ruled that exports of SC paper from Canada to the U.S. have caused or threatened to cause material injury to the U.S. SC paper industry and Commerce issued its final order on the basis of the 17.87% rate. As a result, since October 20, 2015, we have been required to make cash deposits at the 17.87% subsidy rate for estimated and projected countervailing duties on SC papers we import to the U.S. from our Canadian mills. We will be required to continue making cash deposits at that rate until Commerce sets a countervailing duty rate in an administrative review, which may not be finalized until December of 2017, or possibly later. Resolute has appealed the determination of Commerce to a bi-national panel under the North American Free Trade Agreement. A hearing on that appeal was held on October 25, 2016, and Resolute is waiting for the panel's decision. Based on our current operating parameters, the cash deposits could be as high as $25 million per year. As of September 30, 2016 , we have made $21 million of cash deposits. To the extent the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is lower than 17.87% , we will recover excess deposits, plus interest. If the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is at or above 17.87% , the deposits and any deficiency will be converted into actual countervailing duties. We are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter, but we believe it is not probable that we will be assessed with significant countervailing duties. Accordingly, no contingent loss was recorded in respect of this petition in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 . Effective July 31, 2012, we completed the final step of the transaction pursuant to which we acquired the remaining 25.4% of the outstanding Fibrek Inc. (Fibrek) shares, following the approval of Fibreks shareholders on July 23, 2012, and the issuance of a final order of the Quebec Superior Court in Canada approving the arrangement on July 27, 2012. Certain former shareholders of Fibrek exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent in respect of the transaction, asking for a judicial determination of the fair value of their claim under the Canada Business Corporations Act . No consideration has to date been paid to the former Fibrek shareholders who exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent. Any such consideration will only be paid out upon settlement or judicial determination of the fair value of their claims and will be paid entirely in cash. Accordingly, we cannot presently determine the amount that ultimately will be paid to former holders of Fibrek shares in connection with the proceedings, but we have accrued approximately Cdn $14 million ( $11 million , based on the exchange rate 14 Table of Contents RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in effect on September 30, 2016 ) for the eventual payment of those claims. The hearing in this matter is expected to begin in 2019. On June 12, 2012, we filed a motion for directives with the Quebec Superior Court, the Canadian court with jurisdiction in the creditor protection proceedings from which AbitibiBowater Inc. (our predecessor entity) and all but one of its affiliates emerged in 2010 (the Creditor Protection Proceedings), seeking an order to prevent pension regulators in each of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador from declaring partial wind-ups of pension plans relating to employees of former operations in New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, or a declaration that any claim for accelerated reimbursements of deficits arising from a partial wind-up is a barred claim under the Creditor Protection Proceedings. These plans are subject to the funding relief regulations described in Note 13, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans - Canadian pension funding, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and we contend, among other things, that any such declaration, if issued, would be inconsistent with the Quebec Superior Courts sanction order confirming the plan of reorganization and the terms of our emergence from the Creditor Protection Proceedings. A partial wind-up would likely shorten the period in which any deficit within those plans, which could reach up to Cdn $150 million ( $115 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ), would have to be funded if we do not obtain the relief sought. No hearing date has been set to date. Environmental matters We are subject to a variety of federal or national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental regulations promulgated in the future could require substantial additional expenditures for compliance and could have a material impact on us, in particular, and the industry in general. We may be a potentially responsible party with respect to four hazardous waste sites that are being addressed pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act corrective action authority. We believe we will not be liable for any significant amounts at any of these sites. We have recorded $9 million and $12 million of environmental liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, primarily related to environmental remediation related to closed sites. The amount of these liabilities represents managements estimate of the ultimate settlement based on an assessment of relevant factors and assumptions and could be affected by changes in facts or assumptions not currently known to management for which the outcome cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. These liabilities are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have also recorded $22 million and $23 million of asset retirement obligations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, primarily consisting of liabilities associated with landfills, sludge basins and the dismantling of retired assets. These liabilities are included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other matters On October 30, 2014, we received a notice from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry of Ontario (the MNRF) directing us to repay a conditional incentive of Cdn $23 million ( $18 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ) offered in 2007 toward the construction of an electricity-producing turbine, should we fail to restart our Fort Frances, Ontario, pulp and paper mill or otherwise implement an alternative remedy that is acceptable to the MNRF. Several extensions to implement an alternative remedy have been granted to us by the MNRF, with the latest remedy date being January 2, 2017. We announced the permanent closure of the mill in the second quarter of 2014 and have been exploring a number of opportunities for the mill. We are not presently able to determine the outcome of this process, but we currently believe that we could reach an acceptable outcome for the MNRF. Accordingly, we have recorded no contingent liability in respect of this notice in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 . Note 12. Share Capital On May 28, 2015, our board of directors authorized a $50 million increase to our existing $100 million share repurchase program, which was originally launched in May of 2012. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 2.3 million and 5.5 million shares, respectively, at a cost of $22 million and $59 million, respectively. We did not repurchase any shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 . There remains $24 million under the program. 15 Table of Contents RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements Note 13. Segment Information We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Accordingly, our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. None of the income or loss items following Operating income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations are allocated to our segments, since those items are reviewed separately by management. For the same reason, closure costs, impairment and other related charges, inventory write-downs related to closures, start-up costs, gains and losses on disposition of assets, certain components of pension and OPEB costs and credits as well as other discretionary charges or credits are not allocated to our segments. We allocate depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although the related fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are not allocated to segment assets. Additionally, all selling, general and administrative expenses are allocated to our segments, with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under corporate and other.

We have not independently verified the information and cannot assure you of its accuracy. O VERVIEW Resolute Forest Products is a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers, which are marketed in close to 80 countries. The company owns or operates over 40 pulp, paper, tissue and wood products facilities in the United States, Canada and South Korea, as well as power generation assets in Canada and the United States. We are the biggest Canadian producer of wood products east of the Rockies and one of the most significant pulp producers in North America. By capacity, we are the number one producer of newsprint in the world and the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America. We are also an emerging tissue producer. We report our activities in five business segments: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. We are guided by our vision and values, focusing on safety, profitability, accountability, sustainability and teamwork. These are the elements that we believe best define us: \n",
      "Competitive cost structure - as a result of aggressive cost reductions and mill rationalizations, today we compete as a leading, lower-cost North American producer. Maintaining this competitive advantage is our key focus. We are committed to maximizing shareholder value and earnings power by: stressing our guiding principles of operational excellence in everything we do; pushing to optimize our asset base in order to maximize the utilization of our most cost-effective mills; and streamlining production to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Synergistic and diversified asset base - we apply our principles of operational excellence to our synergistic and diversified asset base, one that has evolved with time as we execute our gradual retreat from certain paper grades toward more sustainable long-term businesses. Put simply, we use cash flow from our optimized paper segments to grow our business for the long-term, including: the Calhoun, Tennessee, tissue manufacturing and converting facility scheduled for ramp-up in 2017; the two tissue mills and the three pulp mills we acquired in 2015 and 2012, respectively; the capacity enhancement initiatives in wood products; and the continuous pulp digester project at the Calhoun pulp and paper facility. This synergistic and complementary asset base also offers the fiber management advantage of integration and earnings diversification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial strength - we make disciplined capital management a priority; we believe in maintaining a flexible and conservative capital structure. Our financial strength gives us the ability to consider a range of suitable opportunities to expand our activities in market pulp, tissue and wood products, all of which have strong growth potential.\n",
      "Our Business For information relating to our business, including our products, strategy, sustainable performance and development, and power generation assets, refer to our 2015 Annual Report.

EPS, as adjusted for special items, is calculated as net income (loss), as adjusted for special items, per diluted share. We believe that using these non-GAAP measures is useful because they are consistent with the indicators management uses internally to measure the Companys performance, and it allows the reader to more easily compare our operations and financial performance from period to period. Operating income (loss), net income (loss) and EPS, in each case as adjusted for special items, are internal measures, and therefore may not be comparable to those of other companies.

      "On November 16, 2015 (or the acquisition date ), we acquired Atlas Paper, a manufacturer of a range of tissue products. We began consolidating the results of operations of Atlas Paper in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the acquisition date. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 , the tissue segment generated sales of $23 million and $70 million , respectively, and incurred an operating loss of $5 million and $11 million , respectively. Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 Operating income variance analysis Sales Excluding Atlas Paper sales of $23 million , sales were $40 million, or 4%, lower than in the year-ago period, to $888 million . Volume had a $41 million unfavorable impact, which reflects a decline of 10% in shipments of market pulp, 9% in newsprint and 7% in specialty papers, partially offset by higher shipments in wood products of 20%. Overall pricing was up by $1 million, reflecting an increase of 5% in the average transaction price for wood products and 3% for newsprint, almost entirely offset by a drop of 5% in the average transaction price for market pulp, and 3% for specialty papers. 31 Table of Contents Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs Cost of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization and distribution costs, which we refer to as COS , were $6 million lower in the quarter. After removing the effects of the Canadian dollar fluctuation, given that approximately 60% of our production capacity is based in Canada, and the lower overall volume, offset in part by the COS related to the newly acquired Atlas Paper, manufacturing costs increased by $3 million, reflecting: \n",

Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization was $8 million lower in the quarter, largely reflecting the reduced carrying value of our Catawba, South Carolina, paper assets after the $176 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, the net increase of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment, and the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta, Georgia, mill in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by the depreciation and amortization related to the newly acquired Atlas Paper. Net income (loss) variance analysis Income taxes We recorded an income tax benefit of $14 million in the quarter, on income before income taxes of $1 million , compared to none expected based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects a $37 million adjustment primarily related to the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations of the applicable jurisdictions, partially offset by a $20 million valuation allowance related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an income tax provision of $2 million , on a loss before income taxes of $4 million , compared to an expected income tax benefit of $1 million based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects a $16 million valuation allowance primarily related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets and foreign exchange related items, offset in part by a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes due to an intercompany asset transfer in connection with an operating company realignment. 32 Table of Contents Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 Operating (loss) income variance analysis Sales Excluding Atlas Paper sales of $70 million , sales were $165 million, or 6%, lower than in the year-ago period, to $2,656 million . Sales volume decreased by $45 million because of lower shipments in newsprint, down by 6%, as well as market pulp and specialty papers, both down by 2%, only partially offset by higher shipments in wood products, up by 9%.

The decrease is mostly due to lower fuel surcharges, and the expiration of the SLA in October 2015, under which our Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S. had been subject to export duties ($4 million), offset in part by an increase in average length of haul and higher freight rates. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization was $19 million lower in the period, largely reflecting the reduced carrying value of our Catawba paper assets after the $176 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, the net increase of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment, and the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta mill in the second quarter of 2016, offset in part by depreciation and amortization related to the newly acquired Atlas Paper, our new and refurbished sawmills in Ontario and the implementation of our integrated business management software. Closure costs, impairment and other related charges See the corresponding variance analysis under Segment Earnings Corporate and Other below. Net loss variance analysis Other income, net We recorded other income, net, of $14 million in 2016, compared to $5 million in the year-ago period. This mostly reflects, in the current period, a $5 million gain on the disposition of our 50% interest in Produits Forestiers Petit-Paris Inc. and a non-cash foreign exchange gain of $3 million on the translation of Canadian dollar net monetary balances, compared mainly to a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $2 million in the year-ago period. Income taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $9 million in the period, on a loss before income taxes of $23 million , compared to an expected income tax benefit of $8 million based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects mostly a $65 million valuation allowance related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, partially offset by a $37 million adjustment primarily related to the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations of the applicable jurisdictions, and foreign tax rate differences. In 2015, we recorded an income tax provision of $22 million , on a loss before income taxes of $20 million , compared to an expected income tax benefit of $7 million based on the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. The difference reflects mainly a $43 million valuation allowance primarily related to our U.S. operations where we recognize a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets and foreign exchange items, offset in part by a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes due to an intercompany asset transfer in connection with an operating company realignment and state and foreign tax rate differences. 34 Table of Contents Segment Earnings We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. We do not allocate any of the income or loss items following operating income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to our segments because those items are reviewed separately by management. Similarly, we do not allocate to the segments: closure costs, impairment and other related charges; inventory write-downs related to closures; start-up costs; gains and losses on disposition of assets; non-operating pension and OPEB costs and credits; as well as other discretionary charges or credits. We allocate depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although the related fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are not allocated to segment assets. Additionally, all selling, general and administrative expenses are allocated to our segments, with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under corporate and other. 35 Table of Contents MARKET PULP Highlights \n",

World capacity grew by 3.6% in that time, mostly reflecting the significant expansion of Latin American hardwood capacity. World demand for softwood was up by 3.6% through September. This reflects increases in shipments of 11.1% and 2.5% to China and North America, respectively, while shipments to Western Europe were down by 1.0%. In the same period, demand for hardwood was up by 3.0%, with shipments to China up by 11.4%, while North America and Western Europe were down by 4.7% and 2.5%, respectively. Three months ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 Operating income variance analysis Sales Sales were $32 million lower, or 14% , to $198 million in the quarter. The average transaction price dropped by $29 per metric ton due to softer market conditions in North America, with lower market prices across all grades. Shipments were 37,000 metric tons lower, mainly for softwood grades. The decrease in shipments was in large part due to the timing of the annual outage and operating difficulties in Thunder Bay, Ontario. We recorded 10,000 metric tons of downtime in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 25,000 metric tons in the year-ago period. The third quarter of 2015 included more downtime related to production slowback at our recycled bleached kraft (or RBK ) mills.

      "On November 16, 2015, we acquired Atlas Paper, a manufacturer of a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and private-label at-home markets, including virgin and recycled products, covering economy, value and premium grades and operating two tissue mills and a recycling facility in Florida. We began consolidating the results of operations of Atlas Paper in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of November 16, 2015. 39 Table of Contents Industry trends In the first nine months of the year, total tissue consumption in the U.S. grew by 3.3% against the same period last year. U.S. converted tissue products shipments were up 1.9% in the period compared to the year-ago period, led by away-from home shipments, which grew 2.7%, while at-home shipments increased by 1.6%. U.S. parent roll production in the period showed only a marginal growth of 1.6% from the previous year. Tissue capacity increased by 2.7%, contributing to a 94% average industry operating rate, 1.2% lower than the year-ago period. Three months ended September 30, 2016 Operating loss analysis During the third quarter of 2016, the tissue segment incurred an operating loss of $5 million. The average transaction price was $1,549 per short ton; sales were $23 million on shipments of 15,000 short tons (14,000 metric tons). We began the integration of RBK pulp in the third quarter of 2016 and expect to complete the integration by the end of the year. Nine months ended September 30, 2016 Operating loss analysis During the first nine months of 2016, the tissue segment incurred an operating loss of $11 million. The average transaction price was $1,532 per short ton; sales were $70 million on shipments of 46,000 short tons (42,000 metric tons). COS were $63 million, including $4 million of integration-related costs. We completed the integration of virgin pulp supply with our U.S. pulp network in the first quarter of 2016. The operating results of Atlas Paper were lower than expected. Shipments fell short of set objectives, particularly in converted products sales. Lower productivity on tissue machines and converting lines unfavorably impacted COS, due to reliability and operational issues, as well as high employee turnover. COS were also higher due to one-off integration costs, repairs and maintenance, including reliability-related maintenance costs to bring Atlas Papers facilities to our safety standards, and higher material usage. 40 Table of Contents WOOD PRODUCTS Highlights \n",

Closure costs, impairment and other related charges In 2016, we recorded closure costs, impairment and other related charges of $37 million, primarily for accelerated depreciation associated to the permanent closure of a newsprint machine at our Augusta mill. In the same period last year, we recorded closure costs, impairment and other related charges of $8 million, primarily for impairment of assets, accelerated depreciation, and idling and cleaning costs at our permanently closed Iroquois Falls mill. L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES Capital Resources We rely on cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations, make pension contributions, and finance our working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, from time to time we may use available cash to reduce debt. As of September 30, 2016 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $ 55 million and availability of $465 million under our revolving credit facilities. In our view, we have sufficient financial resources available to finance our business plan, meet working capital requirements and maintain an appropriate level of capital spending. Senior Secured Credit Facility On September 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (or Senior Secured Credit Facility ) for up to $185 million . The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a term loan of $46 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2025 (or Term Loan ), a revolving credit facility of up to $139 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2022 (or Revolving Credit Facility ), and also provides an uncommitted option to increase the Senior Secured Credit Facility by up to $175 million , subject to certain terms and conditions. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a first priority mortgage on the real property of our Calhoun, Tennessee, facility and a first priority security interest on the fixtures and equipment located therein. Interest rates under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are based, at the Companys election, on either a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (or LIBOR ), or a base rate, in each case plus a spread over the index. The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% ; and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1% . The applicable spread over the index fluctuates quarterly based upon the Companys capitalization ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the Companys funded indebtedness to the sum of the Companys funded indebtedness and its net worth. For the Term Loan, the initial applicable spread is 1% for base rate loans and 2% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.875% to 1.5% for base rate loans, and from 1.875% to 2.5% for LIBOR rate loans. For loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the initial applicable spread is 0.625% for base rate loans and 1.625% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.5% to 1.125% for base rate loans, and from 1.5% to 2.125% for LIBOR rate loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was issued by eight lenders within the farm credit system and will be eligible for patronage refunds. Patronage refunds are distributions of profits from lenders in the farm credit system, which are cooperatives that are required to distribute profits to 52 Table of Contents their members. Patronage distributions, which are made in either cash or stock, are received in the year after they were earned. Future refunds will be dependent on future farm credit lender profits, made at the discretion of each farm credit lender. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to pay a fee in respect of unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility equal to 0.325% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 35% of the total revolving commitments, and 0.275% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is greater than 35% of the total revolving commitments. The fee for unutilized commitments will be 0.325% per annum initially. Base rate loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be repaid from time to time at our discretion without premium or penalty. LIBOR rate loans may be repaid from time to time at our discretion, subject to breakage costs, if any. Amounts repaid on the Term Loan may not be subsequently re-borrowed. Principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn, repaid, and redrawn until September 6, 2022. Pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are also required to maintain a capitalization ratio not greater than 45% at all times, available liquidity of not less than $100 million , and a collateral coverage ratio of not less than 1.8 to 1.0 (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence and repayment of indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of liens; (iv) restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries making certain restricted payments; (v) restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations, and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to material indebtedness. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties, and, subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, also contains certain customary events of default.

      "Nine months ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $51 million of cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2016, compared to $90 million in the year-ago period. The decrease is attributable to a reduction in profitability and higher pension contributions mostly related to a previously disclosed supplemental contribution in 2016. Net cash used in investing activities Cash used in investing activities, up $61 million against the year-ago period, consisted mostly of cash invested in fixed assets, which reflects investments in strategic projects such as: the tissue manufacturing and converting facility in Calhoun, for which $110 million was spent in 2016; and the implementation of our integrated business management software. Approximately $120 million of capital expenditures remains to be spent to complete the $270 million Calhoun tissue project. The current period also included countervailing duty cash deposits of $17 million , offset by a consideration of $5 million received from the disposition of our 50% interest in Produits Forestiers Petit-Paris Inc. 53 Table of Contents Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities We borrowed $136 million under our credit facilities in the first nine months of 2016, to sustain the capital expenditures for our continued transformation strategy. In the same period of 2015, we used $62 million in financing activities, almost all of which related to share repurchases. Based on borrowings of $136 million for the first nine months of 2016 and expected capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2016 for our continued transformation strategy, we now expect to borrow approximately $170 million in aggregate in 2016. Countervailing duty cash deposit requirements Since October 20, 2015, we have been required to make cash deposits at a subsidy rate of 17.87% for estimated and projected countervailing duties on SC papers we import to the U.S. from our Canadian mills. Based on our current operating parameters, the cash deposits could be as high as $25 million per year. As of September 30, 2016 , we have made $21 million of cash deposits. For additional information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors We are subject to countervailing duty trade remedies on exports of our SC paper to the U.S., which could adversely affect our operations and cash flows, of the 2015 Annual Report. 54 Table of Contents RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS INC. \n",

      "Information on our legal proceedings is presented under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in our 2015 Annual Report. Except as otherwise provided hereafter, there have been no material changes to the legal proceedings described in the 2015 Annual Report. Effective January 1, 2015, we modified our U.S. OPEB plan so that unionized participants, upon reaching Medicare eligibility, are provided Medicare coverage via a Medicare Exchange program rather than via a Company-sponsored medical plan. On March 2, 2016, a proposed class action lawsuit ( Reynolds, et al v. Resolute Forest Products Inc., Resolute FP US Inc., Resolute FP US Health and Resolute Welfare Benefit Plan ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of certain Medicare-eligible retirees who were previously unionized employees of our Calhoun, Tennessee; Catawba, South Carolina; and Coosa Pines, Alabama, mills, and their spouses and dependents. The plaintiffs allege that the modifications described above breach the collective bargaining agreements and plan covering the members of the proposed class in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the health care benefits as in effect before January 1, 2015, for the proposed class in the lawsuit. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to defend the action. On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The proposed class action lawsuit is at a preliminary stage and no class has been certified. Accordingly, we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter or to reasonably estimate the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On June 23, 2016, Environment Canada charged our subsidiary, Fibrek s.e.n.c., with alleged violations of Sections 36(3) and 38(4) of the Fisheries Act (Canada), which prohibit the deposit or discharge of deleterious substances in water frequented by fish, and require reporting of an irregular discharge, or a serious and imminent risk of an irregular discharge, which results, or could reasonably be expected to result, in detriment to fish, fish habitat, or human use of fish. The charges are based on discharges of effluent in the Mistassini and Ashuapmushan rivers alleged to have occurred at our Saint-Flicien, Quebec, pulp mill between January 2012 and October 2013, before and shortly after we acquired control of Fibrek s.e.n.c. on May 2, 2012. Environment Canada has not yet disclosed to us the specific occurrences of the events alleged to have violated Sections 36(3) and 38(4) of the Fisheries Act (Canada) that will be relied upon, nor the amount of any fine or other remedy that may be sought. The proceeding will be heard by the Court of Quebec ( Cour du Qubec ). Although we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this proceeding, we believe it will not have a material impact on the Company. On October 13, 2016, Environment Canada charged our subsidiary, Resolute FP Canada Inc., with alleged violations of Sections 36(3) and 38(4) of the Fisheries Act (Canada), which prohibit the deposit or discharge of deleterious substances in water frequented by fish, and require reporting of an irregular discharge, or a serious and imminent risk of an irregular discharge, which results, or could reasonably be expected to result, in detriment to fish, fish habitat, or human use of fish. The charges are based on an alleged discharge of bunker fuel into a stream, alleged to have occurred at our Baie-Comeau, Quebec, pulp mill on June 19, 2012. The proceeding will be heard by the Court of Quebec ( Cour du Qubec ). Although we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this proceeding, we believe it will not have a material impact on the Company. \n",

Each notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable, except that such Borrower may, by subsequent notice to the Administrative Agent, revoke any such notice of prepayment if such notice of revocation is received not later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the day on which such prepayment is scheduled to occur and, provided that (i) such Borrower reimburses each Lender pursuant to Section 3.02 for any funding losses within five Business Days after receiving written demand therefor and (ii) the amount of Loans as to which such revocation applies shall be deemed converted to (or continued as, as applicable) Base Rate Loans in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.08 as of the date of notice of revocation (subject to subsequent conversion in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement). Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02 , except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.06 . 2.10. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs . (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Credit Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of amounts payable under Sections 3.01 , 3.02 and 5.01 or otherwise) at or before the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Credit Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in U.S. Dollars in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after the required time on any date may, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office, except that payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 , 3.02 , 5.01 and 13.01 shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Credit Documents shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the 39 appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Credit Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied in the manner as provided in Section 2.09(c) or 11.11 hereof, as applicable, ratably among the parties entitled thereto. (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or portion of the Term Loan resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and its portion of the Term Loan and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and the Term Loan of other applicable Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and portion of the Term Loan; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, Section 13.12 ) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or Affiliate thereof or any Subsidiary of the Company (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Credit Parties rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of a Credit Party in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due under the applicable Facility to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders under the applicable Facility, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.02(c) , 2.02(f) , 2.10(d) , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the 40 Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 2.11. Defaulting Lenders . (a) Reallocation of Pro Rata Share; Amendments . For purposes of determining the Lenders obligations to fund or acquire participations in Loans, the Administrative Agent shall exclude the Commitments and Loans of any Defaulting Lender(s) from the calculation of Pro Rata Shares. A Defaulting Lender shall have no right to vote on any amendment, waiver or other modification of a Credit Document, except to the limited extent provided in Section 13.12 . In no event shall any Lenders obligations pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) cause such Lender to exceed its aggregate Commitment. (b) Payments; Fees . The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, receive and retain any amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender under the Credit Documents, and a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned to the Administrative Agent such amounts until all Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent, Non-Defaulting Lenders and other Secured Creditors have been paid in full. The Administrative Agent may apply such amounts to the Defaulting Lenders defaulted obligations or readvance the amounts to the Company hereunder. A Lender shall not be entitled to receive any fees accruing hereunder during the period in which it is a Defaulting Lender, and the unfunded portion of its Commitment shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the Unused Line Fee under Section 2.05(a) . (c) Cure . The Company and Administrative Agent may agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender. At such time, Pro Rata Shares shall be reallocated without exclusion of such Lenders Commitments and Loans, and all outstanding Loans and other exposures under the Commitments shall be reallocated among Lenders and settled by the Administrative Agent (with appropriate payments by the reinstated Lender) in accordance with the readjusted Pro Rata Shares. Unless expressly agreed in writing by the Company and Administrative Agent, no reinstatement of a Defaulting Lender shall constitute a waiver or release of claims against such Lender. The failure of any Lender to fund a Loan or otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations, and no Lender shall be responsible for default by another Lender. 2.12. [Reserved] . 2.13. Commitment Increases . (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, after the Closing Date, the Company shall have the right to request, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) an increase in the Revolving Commitments (a Revolving Commitment Increase ), (ii) an increase in the aggregate amount of the Term Loan and/or the addition of a separate term loan facility (an Additional Term Loan Facility ) (each such increase or separate facility pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), an Accordion Increase ) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $175,000,000; provided that (x) any Accordion Increase shall be on the terms (including, in the case of a Revolving Commitment Increase or increase in the aggregate amount of the Term Loan, the Latest Maturity Date) and pursuant to the documentation to be agreed upon by the Lenders providing such Accordion Increase, (y) the Company shall only be permitted to request two Accordion Increases during the term of this Agreement and (z) any Accordion Increase shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 or, if less than $25,000,000 is available, the amount left available. 41 (b) Each notice submitted pursuant to this Section 2.13 (an Accordion Increase Notice ) requesting an Accordion Increase shall specify the amount of the increase in the Revolving Commitments or the Term Loan or the amount of the new term loan being requested. Upon receipt of an Accordion Increase Notice, the Administrative Agent may (at the direction of the Company) promptly notify the applicable Lenders and each such Lender may (subject to the Companys consent) have the right to elect to (x) have its Revolving Commitment or Term Loan Commitment increased by its Pro Rata Share (it being understood and agreed that a Lender may elect to have its Revolving Commitment or Term Loan Commitment increased in excess of its Pro Rata Share in its discretion if any other Lender declines to participate in the Accordion Increase) of the requested increase in Revolving Commitments or Term Loan Commitments, as applicable or (y) issue a commitment under the Additional Term Loan Facility; provided that (i) each Lender may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to participate in any Accordion Increase, it being understood that no Lender shall be obligated to participate in an Accordion Increase unless it, in its sole discretion, so agrees and, if a Lender fails to respond to any Accordion Increase Notice within five (5) Business Days after such Lenders receipt of such request, such Lender shall be deemed to have declined to participate in such Accordion Increase; (ii) if any Lender declines to participate in any Accordion Increase and, as a result, commitments from additional financial institutions are required in connection with the Accordion Increase, any Person or Persons providing such commitment shall be subject to the written consent of the Administrative Agent (in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (iii) in no event shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to participate in such Accordion Increase; (iv) neither the funding of the Accordion Increase nor the existence of the Liens securing such Accordion Increase would violate the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture. In the event that any Lender or other Person agrees to participate in any Accordion Increase (each an Increase Loan Lender ), such Accordion Increase shall become effective on such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Increase Loan Lenders and the Company, which date shall be as soon as practicable after the date of receipt of the Accordion Increase Notice (such date, the Increase Date ); provided that the establishment of such Accordion Increase shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (1) no Default or Event of Default would exist after giving effect thereto; (2) the Accordion Increase shall be effected pursuant to one or more joinder agreements executed and delivered by the Company, the Administrative Agent, and the Increase Loan Lenders, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Administrative Agent, and the Increase Loan Lenders; (3) the Credit Parties shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent such amendments to the Credit Documents, legal opinions and other documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with any such transaction, which amendments, legal opinions and other documents shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; (4) the representations and warranties contained in Section 8 shall be true and correct in all material respects (or in all respects to the extent that any representation or warranty is qualified by materiality) as of the Increase Date; (5) the Borrowers shall have paid to the Administrative Agent and the Increase Loan Lenders such additional fees as may be agreed to be paid by the Borrowers in connection therewith; and (6) the Company shall be in compliance with the Collateral Coverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Accordion Increase. (c) On the Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in this Section 2.13 , (i) with respect to any Revolving Commitment Increase, the Administrative Agent shall effect a settlement of all outstanding Revolving Loans among the Lenders that will reflect the adjustments to the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders as a result of the Revolving Commitment Increase, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders and Credit Parties of the occurrence of the Accordion Increase to be effected on the Increase Date, (iii) Schedule 2.01 shall be deemed modified to reflect the revised and/or new Commitments of the affected Lenders and (iv) Notes will be issued, 42 at the expense of the Borrowers, to any Lender participating in the Accordion Increase and requesting a Note. (d) The terms and provisions of (x) the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be identical to the Revolving Loans and the Revolving Commitments and, for purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, all Revolving Loans made under the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be deemed to be Revolving Loans and (y) any Accordion Increase to the existing Term Loan Facility (other than an Additional Term Loan Facility) shall be identical to the Term Loan and the Term Loan Commitments and, each loan made in connection with an Accordion Increase to the existing Term Loan Facility (other than an Additional Term Loan Facility) shall constitute an increase to the existing Term Loan hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) With respect to any Revolving Commitment Increase, (A) the rate of interest applicable to the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be the same as the rate of interest applicable to the existing Revolving Loans, (B) unused line fees applicable to the Revolving Commitment Increase shall be calculated using the same Unused Line Fee Rates applicable to the existing Revolving Loans, (C) the Revolving Commitment Increase shall share ratably in any mandatory prepayments of the Revolving Loans, (D) after giving effect to such Revolving Commitment Increases, Revolving Commitments shall be reduced based on each Lenders Pro Rata Percentage, and (E) the Revolving Commitment Increase shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the existing Revolving Loans. (ii) With respect to any increase to the existing Term Loan, (A) the rate of interest applicable to such Accordion Increase shall be the same as the rate of interest applicable to the existing Term Loan, (B) such Accordion Increase shall share ratably in any mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan, (C) after giving effect to such Accordion Increase, the Term Commitments shall be reduced based on each Lenders Pro Rata Percentage, and (D) such Accordion Increase shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the existing Term Loan. (iii) With respect to any Additional Term Loan Facility, (A) the Company and each Increase Loan Lender providing an Additional Term Loan Facility shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Additional Term Loan Facility Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the commitment of such Increase Loan Lender, (B) the Additional Term Loan Facility Agreement shall specify the pricing, maturity date and other terms of the Additional Term Loan Facility, (C) the final maturity date of the Additional Term Loan Facility shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date for the existing Term Loan, (D) the weighted average life to maturity of the Additional Term Loan Facility shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loan and other existing Additional Term Loan Facility, (E) the Additional Term Loan Facility shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the existing Term Loan, and (F) the other terms and documentation in respect of the Additional Term Loan Facility, to the extent not consistent with the existing Term Loan, shall be as agreed between the Company and the Increase Loan Lenders providing the Additional Term Loan Facility (but in any case subject to the specific limitations and requirements set forth above) and the Administrative Agent. 43 (iv) Each joinder agreement and any amendment to any Credit Document requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with the establishment of an Accordion Increase may, without the consent of any of the Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement (each, an Accordion Agreement ) and the other Credit Documents as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Company, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.13 . 2.14. Subsidiary Borrowers . (a) The Company may at any time, upon not less than 10 Business Days notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), designate any one or more Domestic Subsidiaries of the Company (an Applicant Borrower ) as a Borrower to receive Loans hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit I (a Borrower Designation Request and Assumption Agreement ). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the credit facilities provided for herein the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received such supporting resolutions, constitutional documents, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel, Security Documents, valuations and other documents, instruments or information (including any know-your-customer information requested by the Administrative Agent, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their sole discretion, and Notes signed by such new Borrowers to the extent any Lenders so require. If the Administrative Agent agrees that an Applicant Borrower shall have satisfied all of the requirements of this Section 2.14 and, therefore, be entitled to receive Loans hereunder, then promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency certificates, Security Documents, opinions of counsel and other documents, instruments or information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit H (a Borrower Designation Notice ) to the Company and the Lenders specifying the effective date upon which the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Borrower, whereupon each of the Lenders agrees to permit such Applicant Borrower to become a Borrower and to receive Loans hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and each of the parties agrees that such Applicant Borrower otherwise shall be a Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that no Notice of Borrowing may be submitted by or on behalf of such Applicant Borrower until the date three Business Days after such effective date. (b) The Company may from time to time, upon not less than 10 Business Days notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate any Domestic Subsidiarys status as a Borrower; provided that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Borrower or other amounts payable by such Borrower on account of any Credit Extensions made to it, as of the effective date of such termination (unless such Loans and other Obligations have been assumed by another Borrower). Following the termination of any Subsidiarys status as a Borrower hereunder, such Subsidiary shall, subject to the terms of Section 9.16 , remain a Subsidiary Guarantor and shall remain subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such termination of a Subsidiary Borrowers status. Section 3 Yield Protection, Illegality and Replacement of Lenders . 44 3.01. Increased Costs, Illegality, etc . (a) In the event that any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent): (i) on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBOR Rate; (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan because of any change since the Closing Date in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the official interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, official guideline or request, such as, but not limited to: (A) any Tax imposed on any Lender (except Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnified under Section 5.01 or any Excluded Taxes) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the LIBOR Rate; or (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any LIBOR Rate Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in good faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of law) or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank Eurodollar market; then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice in writing to the Company and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Rate Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by the Relevant Borrower with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by the applicable Borrowers, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, each Borrower, jointly and severally, agrees to pay, to such Lender, upon such Lenders written request therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a written notice setting forth the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, shall be submitted to the Company by such Lender and shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto), (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrowers shall take one of the actions specified in Section 3.01(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law. (b) At any time that any LIBOR Rate Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 3.01(a)(ii) , the Relevant Borrower may, and in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan affected 45 by the circumstances described in Section 3.01(a)(iii) , the Relevant Borrower shall either (x) if the affected LIBOR Rate Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel such Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent written notice on the same date that the Relevant Borrower was notified by the affected Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the affected LIBOR Rate Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert such LIBOR Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period, or such earlier date as may be required by applicable law, provided that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 3.01(b) . (c) If any Lender determines that after the Closing Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy or liquidity, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by the NAIC or any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lenders Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then, each Borrower, jointly and severally, agrees to pay to such Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital or liquidity. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Lenders determination of compensation owing under this Section 3.01(c) shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 3.01(c) , will give prompt written notice thereof to the Company, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III ((x) and (y) collectively referred to as Dodd-Frank and Basel III ), shall be deemed to be a change after the Closing Date in a Requirement of Law or government rule, regulation or order, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented (including for purposes of this Section 3.01 ). (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section (i) for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lenders intention to claim compensation under this Section 3.01 ; provided , however , that, if the introduction or change referred to in Section 3.01(a)(ii) or 3.01(c) giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof; or (ii) such Lender is not charging such costs or reduced return to its borrowers generally with respect to which it has the right to charge such costs. 46 (f) Cost of Funds True-Up . The Borrowers acknowledge that the LIBOR Rate may not represent the true cost of funds incurred by the Lenders in connection with making LIBOR Rate Loans under the Term Loan available to the Borrowers. In recognition of the foregoing, the Borrowers agree that, if the Current Cost of Funds (as defined below) for the seven (7) day period ending on each of the third and sixth anniversaries of the Closing Date (each a Reset Date ) differs from the Closing Date Cost of Funds (as defined below) by more than 15 basis points (in either direction), the Administrative Agent shall have the right, in the case of an increase in the Current Cost of Funds from the Closing Date Cost of Funds, and the obligation, in the case of a decrease in the Current Cost of Funds from the Closing Date Cost of Funds, to adjust the LIBOR Rate applicable to the Term Loan by 100% of the number of basis points by which the Current Cost of Funds differs from the Closing Date Cost of Funds, which increase or decrease shall remain in effect until the earlier of (x) the next Reset Date and (y) repayment in full of all Obligations with respect to the Term Loan Facility. As used herein: (x) Closing Date Cost of Funds means 18 basis points, which is the difference between (A) the all-in LIBOR Floating Note Rate cost of funds paid by the Farm Credit Lenders as indicated by the Farm Credit Funding Corporation and (B) the one-month LIBOR Rate as of the Closing Date. (y) Current Cost of Funds means, as of any Reset Date, the difference, if any, between the average all-in LIBOR Floating Note Rate cost of funds paid by the Farm Credit Lenders as indicated by the Farm Credit Funding Corporation for the seven (7) day period ending on such Reset Date and the average one-month LIBOR Rate for such seven (7) day period. (z) LIBOR Floating Note Rate means, as of any date, the estimated funding cost (not the actual sale price), including standard underwriting fees, for new 3-year floating rate farm credit debt securities issued into the primary market based on market observations on such date indicated at approximately 9:30 a.m. Eastern time; provided that such indications represent the Farm Credit Funding Corporation's best estimate of the cost of new debt issues based on a combination of daily surveys of selected farm credit selling group members (participating bond dealers) and ongoing monitoring of the fixed income markets for actual, recent, primary market issuance by other government-sponsored of similar bonds and notes and pricing within related derivative markets, particularly the interest rate swap market. Historical information on such funding costs is available, for the prior week, on the Farm Credit Funding Corporations website ( http://www.farmcreditfunding.com/ffcb_live/fundingCostIndex.html ) under the Output tab of the most recent spreadsheet. 3.02. Compensation . Each Borrower, jointly and severally, agrees to compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation and the calculation of the amount of such compensation), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its LIBOR Rate Loans but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or other anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of, or conversion from or into, LIBOR Rate Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation (whether or not withdrawn by the applicable Borrower or deemed withdrawn 47 pursuant to Section 3.01(a) ); (ii) if any prepayment or repayment (including any termination or reduction of Commitments made pursuant to Section 2.07 or as a result of an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 11 ) or conversion of any of its LIBOR Rate Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of termination or reduction given by the Company; (iv) as a consequence of (x) any other default by any Borrower to repay its LIBOR Rate Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note held by such Lender or (y) any election made pursuant to Section 3.01(b) . 3.03. Change of Lending Office . Each Lender agrees that on the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.01(a)(ii) or (iii) , Section 3.01(c) or Section 5.01 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Company, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section 3.03 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrowers or the right of any Lender provided in Sections 3.01 and 5.01 . 3.04. Replacement of Lenders .

(b) A Lender may assign to an Eligible Assignee any of its rights and obligations under the Credit Documents, as long as (a) in the case of a partial assignment, is in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by Administrative Agent in its discretion) and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount; (b) except in the case of an assignment in whole of a Lenders rights and obligations, the aggregate amount of the Commitments retained by the transferor Lender is at least $5,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Company in their discretion); and (c) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and recording. Nothing herein shall limit the right of a Lender to pledge or assign any rights under the Credit Documents to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank or the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation; provided , however , that no such pledge or assignment shall release the Lender from its obligations hereunder nor substitute the pledge or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to the Loans or the Commitments assigned. (c) Upon delivery to the Administrative Agent of an assignment notice in the form of Exhibit G and a processing fee of $3,500 (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent in its discretion), the assignment shall become effective as specified in the notice, if it complies with this Section 13.04 . From such effective date, the Eligible Assignee shall for all purposes be a Lender under the Credit Documents, and shall have all rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder. Upon consummation of an assignment, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Company shall make appropriate arrangements for issuance of replacement and/or new Notes, if applicable. The transferee Lender shall comply with Section 5 and deliver, upon request, an administrative questionnaire satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 100 (d) No assignment or participation may be made to a Borrower, Affiliate of a Borrower, Defaulting Lender or natural person. The Administrative Agent has no obligation to determine whether any assignee is permitted under the Credit Documents. Assignment by a Defaulting Lender shall be effective only if there is concurrent satisfaction of all outstanding obligations of the Defaulting Lender under the Credit Documents in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, including payment by the Eligible Assignee or Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent of an aggregate amount sufficient upon distribution (through direct payment, purchases of participations or other methods acceptable to the Administrative Agent) to satisfy all funding and payment liabilities of the Defaulting Lender. If assignment by a Defaulting Lender occurs (by operation of law or otherwise) without compliance with the foregoing sentence, the assignee shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender for all purposes until compliance occurs. (e) The Administrative Agent, acting as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (solely for tax purposes), shall maintain (a) a copy (or electronic equivalent) of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it, and (b) a register for recordation of the names, addresses and Commitments of, and the Loans and interest owing to, each Lender. Entries in the register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and Lenders shall treat each Person recorded in such register as a Lender for all purposes under the Credit Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. The Administrative Agent may choose to show only one Borrower as the borrower in the register, without any effect on the liability of any Credit Party with respect to the Obligations. The register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender, from time to time upon reasonable notice. (f) Subject to this Section 13.04 , any Lender may sell to an Eligible Assignee (in such context, a Participant ) a participating interest in the rights and obligations of such Lender under any Credit Documents. Despite any sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lenders obligations under the Credit Documents shall remain unchanged, it shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for performance of such obligations, it shall remain the holder of its Loans and Commitments for all purposes, all amounts payable by the Borrowers shall be determined as if it had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the Credit Documents. Each Lender shall be solely responsible for notifying its Participants of any matters under the Credit Documents, and the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall not have any obligation or liability to any such Participant. (g) Subject to Section 13.04(h) , the Credit Parties agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 , 3.02 and 5.01 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections and Section 3.04 ) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 13.04(b) . To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits under this Agreement as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.10 as though it were a Lender. (h) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 , 3.02 or 5.01 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant except to the extent such entitlement to a greater payment results from a change in law occurring after the sale of the participation takes place. (i) Subject to Section 13.04(l) , each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, waiver or other modification of a Credit Document 101 other than that which forgives principal, interest or fees, reduces the stated interest rate or fees payable with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest, postpones any relevant Maturity Date or any date fixed for any regularly scheduled payment of principal, interest or fees on such Loan or Commitment, or releases any Borrower, Guarantor or substantially all Collateral. (j) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (solely for Tax purposes), maintain a register (the Participant Register ) in which it enters the Participants name, address and interest in Commitments and Loans (and stated interest). Entries in the register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person recorded in the register as the owner of the participation for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. No Lender shall have an obligation to disclose any information in such register except to the extent necessary to establish that a Participants interest is in registered form under the Code. (k) Borrowers agree that each Participant shall have a right of setoff in respect of its participating interest to the same extent as if such interest were owing directly to a Lender, and each Lender shall also retain the right of setoff with respect to any participating interests sold by it. By exercising any right of setoff, a Participant agrees to share with Lenders all amounts received through its setoff, in accordance with Section 2.10(c) as if such Participant were a Lender. (l) Notwithstanding anything in Section 13.04 to the contrary, any Farm Credit Lender that (a) has purchased a participation or sub-participation in the Loans in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 on or after the Closing Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Company and Administrative Agent ( Voting Participant Notification ), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a Voting Participant ) and (c) receives the prior written consent of the Company and Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant (to the extent such consent would be required pursuant to Section 13.04(b) if such transfer were an assignment rather than a sale of a participation or sub-participation), shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an assignee as set forth in Exhibit F hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation or sub-participation purchased. The Company and Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each bank or other lending institution that is a member of the Farm Credit System designated as a Voting Participant in Schedule 13.04(l) hereto shall be a Voting Participant without delivery of a Voting Participant Notification and without the prior written consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent. The voting rights of each Voting Participant are solely for the benefit of such Voting Participant and shall not inure to any assignee or participant of such Voting Participant that is not otherwise a Voting Participant. 13.05. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative . No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrowers or any other Credit Party and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document 102 preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 13.06. [ Reserved ] . 13.07. Calculations; Computations . (a) The financial statements to be furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect from time to time; provided that if the Company notifies the Administrative Agent that it requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith. The Company shall have the right, if required by relevant regulatory authorities, to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards, as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (or any successor board or agency), as in effect on the date of the election, which election shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be treated as a permitted change in GAAP and shall be subject to the terms of the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 141R or ASC 805 (or any other financial accounting standard having a similar result or effect). (b) The calculation of any financial ratios under this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-down if there is no nearest number). 13.08. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL . (a) UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT, THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND ALL CLAIMS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES EXCEPT FEDERAL LAWS RELATING TO NATIONAL BANKS. (b) EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTRY OR THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, IN ANY DISPUTE, ACTION, LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY CREDIT DOCUMENTS, AND AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE, ACTION, 103 LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING SHALL BE BROUGHT BY IT SOLELY IN ANY SUCH COURT. EACH CREDIT PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL CLAIMS, OBJECTIONS AND DEFENSES THAT IT MAY HAVE REGARDING ANY SUCH COURTS PERSONAL OR SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, VENUE OR INCONVENIENT FORUM. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 13.03 . A final judgment in any proceeding of any such court shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or any other manner provided by applicable law. (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. 13.09. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Company and the Administrative Agent. 13.10. [ Reserved ] . 13.11. Headings Descriptive . The headings of the several Sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. 13.12. Amendment or Waiver; etc .

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause (a) of this Section 13.12 , the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Lender providing the relevant Accordion Increase may, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.13 , enter into an Accordion Agreement or Additional Term Loan Facility Agreement; provided that after the execution and delivery by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each such Lender may thereafter only be modified in accordance with the requirements of clause (a) above of this Section 13.12 .

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any fee letter may be amended, or rights and privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto. (f) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such period as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender will not be entitled to vote in respect of amendments, waivers and consents hereunder and the Commitment and the outstanding Loans or other extensions of credit of such Lender hereunder will not be taken into account in determining whether the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as required, have approved any such amendment, waiver or consent (and the definition of Required Lenders will automatically be deemed modified accordingly for the duration of such period); provided that any such amendment or waiver that would increase or extend the term of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, extend the date fixed for the payment of principal or interest owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, reduce the principal amount of any obligation owing to such Defaulting Lender, reduce the amount of or the rate or amount of interest on any amount owing to such Defaulting Lender or of any fee payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or alter the terms of this proviso, will require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

Domicile of Loans . Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans at, to or for the account of any office, branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender.

Register . The Borrowers hereby designate the Administrative Agent to serve as its agent, solely for purposes of this Section 13.15 , to maintain a register (the Register ) on which it will record the Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders, the Commitments and principal amount (and related interest amounts) of Loans by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.

The liability of each Credit Party hereunder is primary, absolute and unconditional, exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, whether executed by any other guarantor or by any other party, and each Credit Party understands and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted under law, that the liability of such Credit Party hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by any Relevant Guaranteed Party or by any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking (other than payment in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations), or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by any Relevant Guaranteed Party, or (e) any payment made to any Guaranteed Creditor on the Relevant Guaranteed 109 Obligations which any such Guaranteed Creditor repays to any Relevant Guaranteed Party pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, winding up or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Credit Party waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, or (f) any action or inaction by the Guaranteed Creditors as contemplated in Section 14.05 , or (g) any invalidity, irregularity or enforceability of all or any part of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor, or (h) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Credit Party or any other Person liable for any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, or (i) any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, winding up or other debtor relief proceeding affecting any Credit Party, or their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Credit Party, or (j) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which any Credit Party may have at any time against any other Credit Party, a Guaranteed Creditor, or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions, or (k) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, a Credit Party in respect of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or a Credit Party in respect of this Credit Party Guaranty or the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. 14.04. Independent Obligation . The obligations of each Credit Party hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor, any other party or any Relevant Guaranteed Party, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against any Credit Party whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor, any other party or any Relevant Guaranteed Party and whether or not any other guarantor, any other party or any Relevant Guaranteed Party be joined in any such action or actions. Each Credit Party waives, in its capacity as a Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by any Relevant Guaranteed Party or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to such Relevant Guaranteed Party shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to the relevant Credit Party. 14.05. Authorization . To the fullest extent permitted under law, each Credit Party authorizes the Guaranteed Creditors without notice or demand, and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to: (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest or fees thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Credit Party Guaranty shall apply to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered; (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset there against; (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other Credit Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting; (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, any Relevant Guaranteed Party, other Credit Parties or other obligors; 110 (e) settle or compromise any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to its creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors; (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of such Relevant Guaranteed Party remain unpaid; (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Secured Hedging Obligations or any of the instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Secured Hedging Obligations or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or (h) take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of such Credit Party from its liabilities under this Credit Party Guaranty. 14.06. Reliance . It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Relevant Guaranteed Party or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Relevant Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder. 14.07. Subordination . Any indebtedness of any Relevant Guaranteed Party now or hereafter owing to any Credit Party is hereby subordinated to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to such Credit Party shall be collected, enforced and received by such Credit Party for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of any Credit Party under the other provisions of this Credit Party Guaranty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Credit Party hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Credit Party Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash. 14.08. Waiver . (a) Each Credit Party waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable law and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditors power whatsoever. Each Credit Party waives any defense (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) based on or arising out of any defense of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from 111 any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party other than payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment. The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Credit Party hereunder except to the extent the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been paid. Each Credit Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted under law, any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Credit Party against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security. (b) Each Credit Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted under law, all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Credit Party Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. Each Credit Party assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Relevant Guaranteed Partys financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Credit Party assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the other Guaranteed Creditors shall have any duty to advise any Credit Party of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks. 14.09. Maximum Liability . It is the desire and intent of each Credit Party and the Guaranteed Creditors that this Credit Party Guaranty shall be enforced against such Credit Party to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If, however, and to the extent that, the obligations of any Credit Party under this Credit Party Guaranty shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable federal, state, provincial or foreign law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers), then the amount of such Credit Partys obligations under this Credit Party Guaranty shall be deemed to be reduced and such Credit Party shall pay the maximum amount of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations which would be permissible under applicable law. 14.10. Payments . All payments made by a Credit Party pursuant to this Section 14 will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.06 . 14.11. Keepwell . Each Credit Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Credit Party Guaranty or the grant of the security interest under the Credit Documents, in each case, by any Specified Credit Party, becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Credit Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Credit Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under this Credit Party Guaranty and the other Credit Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantors obligations and undertakings under this Section 14 voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 14.11 shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and 112 performed in full. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends this Section 14.11 to constitute, and this Section 14.11 shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of, each Specified Credit Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. 14.12. Information . Each Credit Party assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each applicable Borrowers financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of non-payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Credit Party assumes and incurs under this guarantee, and agrees that no Guaranteed Creditor shall have any duty to advise any Credit Party of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks. 14.13. Severability . If any provision of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.13 , if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by debtor relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. * * * 113 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused their duly authorized officers to execute and deliver this Agreement as of the date first above written.

      "We periodically review the estimated economic useful lives of our fixed assets. Based on this review, during the first quarter of 2016, we prospectively changed our estimate of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment to reflect a net increase of estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment were changed to a range of five to 25 years , increasing the weighted-average estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment by two years . The effect of this change in estimate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was to reduce Depreciation and amortization, and increase Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. , and basic and diluted Net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. common shareholders in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows: (Unaudited, in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Depreciation and amortization $ 3 $ 9 Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 2 5 Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 \n",

      "Note 2. Acquisition of Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. On November 16, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Atlas Paper), a manufacturer of a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and private-label at-home markets, including virgin and recycled products, covering economy, value and premium grades and operating two tissue mills and a recycling facility in Florida. In 2016, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the purchase price allocation due to a change in our preliminary valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, which is still subject to adjustment during the 12-month measurement period following the acquisition date or upon completion of the final valuation. As a result, we increased Goodwill by $2 million and decreased Fixed assets, net and Amortizable intangible assets, net, each by $1 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 . We are still in the process of evaluating new information relating to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to validate the valuation of certain acquired intangibles assets, which will result in a reallocation of the purchase price. We are presently finalizing the amounts of the reallocation of the purchase price and expect to record a decrease to Amortizable intangible assets, net, which could range from $25 million to $35 million, and a corresponding increase to Goodwill, net of tax of approximately $10 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the fourth quarter of 2016, prior to the completion of the measurement period, as permitted. The amount of Atlas Papers sales and net loss included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations were $23 million and $5 million , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and were $70 million and $11 million , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 .

      "Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies Legal matters We become involved in various legal proceedings and other disputes in the normal course of business, including matters related to contracts, commercial disputes, taxes, environmental issues, activists damages, employment and workers compensation claims, Aboriginal claims and other matters. Although the final outcome is subject to many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, we regularly assess the status of the matters and establish provisions (including legal costs expected to be incurred) when we believe an adverse outcome is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Except as described below and for claims that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters outstanding or pending as of September 30, 2016 , will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2015, we modified our U.S. OPEB plan so that unionized participants, upon reaching Medicare eligibility, are provided Medicare coverage via a Medicare Exchange program rather than via a Company-sponsored medical plan. On March 2, 2016, a proposed class action lawsuit ( Reynolds, et al v. Resolute Forest Products Inc., Resolute FP US Inc., Resolute FP US Health and Resolute Welfare Benefit Plan ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of certain Medicare-eligible retirees who were previously unionized employees of our Calhoun, Tennessee; Catawba, South Carolina; and Coosa Pines, Alabama, mills, and their spouses and dependents. The plaintiffs allege that the modifications described above breach the collective bargaining agreements and plan covering the members of the proposed class in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the health care benefits as in effect before January 1, 2015, for the proposed class in the lawsuit. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to defend the action. On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The proposed class action lawsuit is at a preliminary stage and no class has been certified. Accordingly, we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter or to reasonably estimate the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 26, 2015, a countervailing duty petition was filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (Trade Commission) by certain U.S. supercalendered (SC) paper producers requesting the U.S. government to impose countervailing duties on Canadian-origin SC paper exported to the U.S. market. One of our subsidiaries was identified in the petition as being a Canadian exporting producer of SC paper to the U.S. and was selected as a mandatory respondent to be individually investigated by Commerce. On August 3, 2015, Commerce assigned a preliminary subsidy rate of 2.04% to our SC paper produced at our Canadian mills. On October 15, 2015, Commerce issued a final determination and increased the subsidy rate applicable to our Canadian-produced SC paper to 17.87% . In December 2015, the Trade Commission ruled that exports of SC paper from Canada to the U.S. have caused or threatened to cause material injury to the U.S. SC paper industry and Commerce issued its final order on the basis of the 17.87% rate. As a result, since October 20, 2015, we have been required to make cash deposits at the 17.87% subsidy rate for estimated and projected countervailing duties on SC papers we import to the U.S. from our Canadian mills. We will be required to continue making cash deposits at that rate until Commerce sets a countervailing duty rate in an administrative review, which may not be finalized until December of 2017, or possibly later. Resolute has appealed the determination of Commerce to a bi-national panel under the North American Free Trade Agreement. A hearing on that appeal was held on October 25, 2016, and Resolute is waiting for the panel's decision. Based on our current operating parameters, the cash deposits could be as high as $25 million per year. As of September 30, 2016 , we have made $21 million of cash deposits. To the extent the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is lower than 17.87% , we will recover excess deposits, plus interest. If the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is at or above 17.87% , the deposits and any deficiency will be converted into actual countervailing duties. We are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter, but we believe it is not probable that we will be assessed with significant countervailing duties. Accordingly, no contingent loss was recorded in respect of this petition in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 . Effective July 31, 2012, we completed the final step of the transaction pursuant to which we acquired the remaining 25.4% of the outstanding Fibrek Inc. (Fibrek) shares, following the approval of Fibreks shareholders on July 23, 2012, and the issuance of a final order of the Quebec Superior Court in Canada approving the arrangement on July 27, 2012. Certain former shareholders of Fibrek exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent in respect of the transaction, asking for a judicial determination of the fair value of their claim under the Canada Business Corporations Act . No consideration has to date been paid to the former Fibrek shareholders who exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent. Any such consideration will only be paid out upon settlement or judicial determination of the fair value of their claims and will be paid entirely in cash. Accordingly, we cannot presently determine the amount that ultimately will be paid to former holders of Fibrek shares in connection with the proceedings, but we have accrued approximately Cdn $14 million ( $11 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ) for the eventual payment of those claims. The hearing in this matter is expected to begin in 2019. On June 12, 2012, we filed a motion for directives with the Quebec Superior Court, the Canadian court with jurisdiction in the creditor protection proceedings from which AbitibiBowater Inc. (our predecessor entity) and all but one of its affiliates emerged in 2010 (the Creditor Protection Proceedings), seeking an order to prevent pension regulators in each of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador from declaring partial wind-ups of pension plans relating to employees of former operations in New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, or a declaration that any claim for accelerated reimbursements of deficits arising from a partial wind-up is a barred claim under the Creditor Protection Proceedings. These plans are subject to the funding relief regulations described in Note 13, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans - Canadian pension funding, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and we contend, among other things, that any such declaration, if issued, would be inconsistent with the Quebec Superior Courts sanction order confirming the plan of reorganization and the terms of our emergence from the Creditor Protection Proceedings. A partial wind-up would likely shorten the period in which any deficit within those plans, which could reach up to Cdn $150 million ( $115 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ), would have to be funded if we do not obtain the relief sought. No hearing date has been set to date. Environmental matters We are subject to a variety of federal or national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental regulations promulgated in the future could require substantial additional expenditures for compliance and could have a material impact on us, in particular, and the industry in general. We may be a potentially responsible party with respect to four hazardous waste sites that are being addressed pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act corrective action authority. We believe we will not be liable for any significant amounts at any of these sites. We have recorded $9 million and $12 million of environmental liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, primarily related to environmental remediation related to closed sites. The amount of these liabilities represents managements estimate of the ultimate settlement based on an assessment of relevant factors and assumptions and could be affected by changes in facts or assumptions not currently known to management for which the outcome cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. These liabilities are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have also recorded $22 million and $23 million of asset retirement obligations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, primarily consisting of liabilities associated with landfills, sludge basins and the dismantling of retired assets. These liabilities are included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other matters On October 30, 2014, we received a notice from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry of Ontario (the MNRF) directing us to repay a conditional incentive of Cdn $23 million ( $18 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ) offered in 2007 toward the construction of an electricity-producing turbine, should we fail to restart our Fort Frances, Ontario, pulp and paper mill or otherwise implement an alternative remedy that is acceptable to the MNRF. Several extensions to implement an alternative remedy have been granted to us by the MNRF, with the latest remedy date being January 2, 2017. We announced the permanent closure of the mill in the second quarter of 2014 and have been exploring a number of opportunities for the mill. We are not presently able to determine the outcome of this process, but we currently believe that we could reach an acceptable outcome for the MNRF. Accordingly, we have recorded no contingent liability in respect of this notice in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 . \n",

      "Note 8. Long-Term Debt Overview Long-term debt, including current portion, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , was comprised of the following: (Unaudited, in millions) September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 5.875% senior notes due 2023: Principal amount $ 600 $ 600 Deferred financing costs (6 ) (7 ) Unamortized discount (4 ) (4 ) Total senior notes due 2023 590 589 Term loan due 2025 46 Borrowings under revolving credit facilities 90 Capital lease obligation 1 2 Total debt 727 591 Less: Current portion of long-term debt (1 ) (1 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 726 $ 590 2023 Notes We issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) on May 8, 2013. Upon their issuance, the notes were recorded at their fair value of $594 million , which reflected a discount of $6 million that is being amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of the notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6% . Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, until their maturity date of May 15, 2023. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we incurred financing costs of approximately $9 million , which were deferred and recorded as a reduction of the notes. These deferred financing costs are being amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of the notes. The fair value of the 2023 Notes was $522 million and $440 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, and was determined by reference to over-the-counter prices (Level 1). ABL Credit Facility Our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility) has a maturity date of May 22, 2020 and provides an aggregate lender commitment of up to $600 million at any time outstanding, subject to borrowing base availability based on specified advance rates, eligibility criteria and customary reserves. As of September 30, 2016 , we had $376 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility, net of $40 million of borrowings and $29 million of ordinary course letters of credit outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the ABL Credit Facility approximated its carrying value as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). Senior Secured Credit Facility On September 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility) for up to $185 million . The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a term loan of $46 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2025 (Term Loan), a revolving credit facility of up to $139 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2022 (Revolving Credit Facility), and also provides an uncommitted option to increase the Senior Secured Credit Facility by up to $175 million , subject to certain terms and conditions. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a first priority mortgage on the real property of our Calhoun, Tennessee, facility and a first priority security interest on the fixtures and equipment located therein. Interest rates under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are based, at the Companys election, on either a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or a base rate, in each case plus a spread over the index. The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% ; and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1% . The applicable spread over the index fluctuates quarterly based upon the Companys capitalization ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the Companys funded indebtedness to the sum of the Companys funded indebtedness and its net worth. For the Term Loan, the initial applicable spread is 1% for base rate loans and 2% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.875% to 1.5% for base rate loans, and from 1.875% to 2.5% for LIBOR rate loans. For loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the initial applicable spread is 0.625% for base rate loans and 1.625% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.5% to 1.125% for base rate loans, and from 1.5% to 2.125% for LIBOR rate loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was issued by eight lenders within the farm credit system and will be eligible for patronage refunds. Patronage refunds are distributions of profits from lenders in the farm credit system, which are cooperatives that are required to distribute profits to their members. Patronage distributions, which are made in either cash or stock, are received in the year after they were earned. Future refunds will be dependent on future farm credit lender profits, made at the discretion of each farm credit lender. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to pay a fee in respect of unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility equal to 0.325% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 35% of the total revolving commitments, and 0.275% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is greater than 35% of the total revolving commitments. The fee for unutilized commitments will be 0.325% per annum initially. Base rate loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be repaid from time to time at our discretion without premium or penalty. LIBOR rate loans may be repaid from time to time at our discretion, subject to breakage costs, if any. Amounts repaid on the Term Loan may not be subsequently re-borrowed. Principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn, repaid, and redrawn until September 6, 2022. Pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are also required to maintain a capitalization ratio not greater than 45% at all times, available liquidity of not less than $100 million , and a collateral coverage ratio of not less than 1.8 to 1.0 (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence and repayment of indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of liens; (iv) restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries making certain restricted payments; (v) restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations, and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to material indebtedness. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties, and, subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, also contains certain customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016 , we had $89 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $50 million of borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the fair values of the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility approximated their carrying values as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). Capital lease obligation We have a capital lease obligation for a warehouse with a maturity date of December 1, 2017, which can be renewed for 20 years at our option. Minimum monthly payments are determined by an escalatory price clause. \n",

      "Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Nature of operations Resolute Forest Products Inc. (with its subsidiaries and affiliates, either individually or collectively, unless otherwise indicated, referred to as Resolute Forest Products, we, our, us, Parent or the Company) is incorporated in Delaware. We are a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers, which are marketed in close to 80 countries. We own or operate over 40 pulp, paper, tissue and wood products facilities in the United States, Canada and South Korea, as well as power generation assets in Canada and the United States. Financial statements Our interim Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) for interim reporting. Under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are normally required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles may be condensed or omitted. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. The results for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 , filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016 . Certain prior period amounts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on total assets. Change in depreciable lives of machinery and equipment We periodically review the estimated economic useful lives of our fixed assets. Based on this review, during the first quarter of 2016, we prospectively changed our estimate of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment to reflect a net increase of estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment were changed to a range of five to 25 years , increasing the weighted-average estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment by two years . The effect of this change in estimate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was to reduce Depreciation and amortization, and increase Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. , and basic and diluted Net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. common shareholders in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows: (Unaudited, in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Depreciation and amortization $ 3 $ 9 Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 2 5 Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 New accounting pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions.

      "Organization and Basis of Presentation Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Nature of operations Resolute Forest Products Inc. (with its subsidiaries and affiliates, either individually or collectively, unless otherwise indicated, referred to as Resolute Forest Products, we, our, us, Parent or the Company) is incorporated in Delaware. We are a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers, which are marketed in close to 80 countries. We own or operate over 40 pulp, paper, tissue and wood products facilities in the United States, Canada and South Korea, as well as power generation assets in Canada and the United States. Financial statements Our interim Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) for interim reporting. Under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are normally required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles may be condensed or omitted. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. The results for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 , filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016 . Certain prior period amounts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on total assets. Change in depreciable lives of machinery and equipment We periodically review the estimated economic useful lives of our fixed assets. Based on this review, during the first quarter of 2016, we prospectively changed our estimate of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment to reflect a net increase of estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment were changed to a range of five to 25 years , increasing the weighted-average estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment by two years . The effect of this change in estimate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was to reduce Depreciation and amortization, and increase Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. , and basic and diluted Net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. common shareholders in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows: (Unaudited, in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Depreciation and amortization $ 3 $ 9 Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 2 5 Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 New accounting pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective or prospective basis as required for each amendment. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, respectively, which further affect the guidance of ASU 2014-09. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces the current expected credit losses model in the estimation of credit losses on financial instruments. This update is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact the presentation of our cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory until the transferred assets are sold to a third party or recovered through use. This update is effective on a modified retrospective approach for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period, we plan to adopt this ASU as of January 1, 2017, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to Deficit in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. The adoption of this accounting guidance will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

      "Acquisition of Atlas Inc. Note 2. Acquisition of Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. On November 16, 2015 (the acquisition date), we acquired Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Atlas Paper), a manufacturer of a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and private-label at-home markets, including virgin and recycled products, covering economy, value and premium grades and operating two tissue mills and a recycling facility in Florida. In 2016, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the purchase price allocation due to a change in our preliminary valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, which is still subject to adjustment during the 12-month measurement period following the acquisition date or upon completion of the final valuation. As a result, we increased Goodwill by $2 million and decreased Fixed assets, net and Amortizable intangible assets, net, each by $1 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 . We are still in the process of evaluating new information relating to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to validate the valuation of certain acquired intangibles assets, which will result in a reallocation of the purchase price. We are presently finalizing the amounts of the reallocation of the purchase price and expect to record a decrease to Amortizable intangible assets, net, which could range from $25 million to $35 million, and a corresponding increase to Goodwill, net of tax of approximately $10 million, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the fourth quarter of 2016, prior to the completion of the measurement period, as permitted. The amount of Atlas Papers sales and net loss included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations were $23 million and $5 million , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and were $70 million and $11 million , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 . The following unaudited pro forma information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 represents our results of operations as if the acquisition of Atlas Paper had occurred on January 1, 2015.

      "Long-Term Debt Note 8. Long-Term Debt Overview Long-term debt, including current portion, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , was comprised of the following: (Unaudited, in millions) September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 5.875% senior notes due 2023: Principal amount $ 600 $ 600 Deferred financing costs (6 ) (7 ) Unamortized discount (4 ) (4 ) Total senior notes due 2023 590 589 Term loan due 2025 46 Borrowings under revolving credit facilities 90 Capital lease obligation 1 2 Total debt 727 591 Less: Current portion of long-term debt (1 ) (1 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 726 $ 590 2023 Notes We issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes) on May 8, 2013. Upon their issuance, the notes were recorded at their fair value of $594 million , which reflected a discount of $6 million that is being amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of the notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6% . Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, until their maturity date of May 15, 2023. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we incurred financing costs of approximately $9 million , which were deferred and recorded as a reduction of the notes. These deferred financing costs are being amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the interest method over the term of the notes. The fair value of the 2023 Notes was $522 million and $440 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, and was determined by reference to over-the-counter prices (Level 1). ABL Credit Facility Our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility) has a maturity date of May 22, 2020 and provides an aggregate lender commitment of up to $600 million at any time outstanding, subject to borrowing base availability based on specified advance rates, eligibility criteria and customary reserves. As of September 30, 2016 , we had $376 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility, net of $40 million of borrowings and $29 million of ordinary course letters of credit outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the ABL Credit Facility approximated its carrying value as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). Senior Secured Credit Facility On September 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility) for up to $185 million . The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a term loan of $46 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2025 (Term Loan), a revolving credit facility of up to $139 million with a maturity date of September 7, 2022 (Revolving Credit Facility), and also provides an uncommitted option to increase the Senior Secured Credit Facility by up to $175 million , subject to certain terms and conditions. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by a first priority mortgage on the real property of our Calhoun, Tennessee, facility and a first priority security interest on the fixtures and equipment located therein. Interest rates under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are based, at the Companys election, on either a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or a base rate, in each case plus a spread over the index. The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% ; and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1% . The applicable spread over the index fluctuates quarterly based upon the Companys capitalization ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the Companys funded indebtedness to the sum of the Companys funded indebtedness and its net worth. For the Term Loan, the initial applicable spread is 1% for base rate loans and 2% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.875% to 1.5% for base rate loans, and from 1.875% to 2.5% for LIBOR rate loans. For loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the initial applicable spread is 0.625% for base rate loans and 1.625% for LIBOR rate loans and thereafter will range from 0.5% to 1.125% for base rate loans, and from 1.5% to 2.125% for LIBOR rate loans. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was issued by eight lenders within the farm credit system and will be eligible for patronage refunds. Patronage refunds are distributions of profits from lenders in the farm credit system, which are cooperatives that are required to distribute profits to their members. Patronage distributions, which are made in either cash or stock, are received in the year after they were earned. Future refunds will be dependent on future farm credit lender profits, made at the discretion of each farm credit lender. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to pay a fee in respect of unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility equal to 0.325% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 35% of the total revolving commitments, and 0.275% per annum when average daily utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility for the prior fiscal quarter is greater than 35% of the total revolving commitments. The fee for unutilized commitments will be 0.325% per annum initially. Base rate loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be repaid from time to time at our discretion without premium or penalty. LIBOR rate loans may be repaid from time to time at our discretion, subject to breakage costs, if any. Amounts repaid on the Term Loan may not be subsequently re-borrowed. Principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be drawn, repaid, and redrawn until September 6, 2022. Pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are also required to maintain a capitalization ratio not greater than 45% at all times, available liquidity of not less than $100 million , and a collateral coverage ratio of not less than 1.8 to 1.0 (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence and repayment of indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of liens; (iv) restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries making certain restricted payments; (v) restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations, and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to material indebtedness. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties, and, subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, also contains certain customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016 , we had $89 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $50 million of borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the fair values of the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility approximated their carrying values as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities (Level 2). Capital lease obligation We have a capital lease obligation for a warehouse with a maturity date of December 1, 2017, which can be renewed for 20 years at our option. Minimum monthly payments are determined by an escalatory price clause.

      "Commitments and Contingencies Disclosure [Abstract] \n",
      "Commitments and Contingencies Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies Legal matters We become involved in various legal proceedings and other disputes in the normal course of business, including matters related to contracts, commercial disputes, taxes, environmental issues, activists damages, employment and workers compensation claims, Aboriginal claims and other matters. Although the final outcome is subject to many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, we regularly assess the status of the matters and establish provisions (including legal costs expected to be incurred) when we believe an adverse outcome is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Except as described below and for claims that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters outstanding or pending as of September 30, 2016 , will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2015, we modified our U.S. OPEB plan so that unionized participants, upon reaching Medicare eligibility, are provided Medicare coverage via a Medicare Exchange program rather than via a Company-sponsored medical plan. On March 2, 2016, a proposed class action lawsuit ( Reynolds, et al v. Resolute Forest Products Inc., Resolute FP US Inc., Resolute FP US Health and Resolute Welfare Benefit Plan ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of certain Medicare-eligible retirees who were previously unionized employees of our Calhoun, Tennessee; Catawba, South Carolina; and Coosa Pines, Alabama, mills, and their spouses and dependents. The plaintiffs allege that the modifications described above breach the collective bargaining agreements and plan covering the members of the proposed class in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the health care benefits as in effect before January 1, 2015, for the proposed class in the lawsuit. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to defend the action. On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The proposed class action lawsuit is at a preliminary stage and no class has been certified. Accordingly, we are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter or to reasonably estimate the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 26, 2015, a countervailing duty petition was filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (Trade Commission) by certain U.S. supercalendered (SC) paper producers requesting the U.S. government to impose countervailing duties on Canadian-origin SC paper exported to the U.S. market. One of our subsidiaries was identified in the petition as being a Canadian exporting producer of SC paper to the U.S. and was selected as a mandatory respondent to be individually investigated by Commerce. On August 3, 2015, Commerce assigned a preliminary subsidy rate of 2.04% to our SC paper produced at our Canadian mills. On October 15, 2015, Commerce issued a final determination and increased the subsidy rate applicable to our Canadian-produced SC paper to 17.87% . In December 2015, the Trade Commission ruled that exports of SC paper from Canada to the U.S. have caused or threatened to cause material injury to the U.S. SC paper industry and Commerce issued its final order on the basis of the 17.87% rate. As a result, since October 20, 2015, we have been required to make cash deposits at the 17.87% subsidy rate for estimated and projected countervailing duties on SC papers we import to the U.S. from our Canadian mills. We will be required to continue making cash deposits at that rate until Commerce sets a countervailing duty rate in an administrative review, which may not be finalized until December of 2017, or possibly later. Resolute has appealed the determination of Commerce to a bi-national panel under the North American Free Trade Agreement. A hearing on that appeal was held on October 25, 2016, and Resolute is waiting for the panel's decision. Based on our current operating parameters, the cash deposits could be as high as $25 million per year. As of September 30, 2016 , we have made $21 million of cash deposits. To the extent the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is lower than 17.87% , we will recover excess deposits, plus interest. If the countervailing duty rate set by Commerce is at or above 17.87% , the deposits and any deficiency will be converted into actual countervailing duties. We are not presently able to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter, but we believe it is not probable that we will be assessed with significant countervailing duties. Accordingly, no contingent loss was recorded in respect of this petition in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 . Effective July 31, 2012, we completed the final step of the transaction pursuant to which we acquired the remaining 25.4% of the outstanding Fibrek Inc. (Fibrek) shares, following the approval of Fibreks shareholders on July 23, 2012, and the issuance of a final order of the Quebec Superior Court in Canada approving the arrangement on July 27, 2012. Certain former shareholders of Fibrek exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent in respect of the transaction, asking for a judicial determination of the fair value of their claim under the Canada Business Corporations Act . No consideration has to date been paid to the former Fibrek shareholders who exercised (or purported to exercise) rights of dissent. Any such consideration will only be paid out upon settlement or judicial determination of the fair value of their claims and will be paid entirely in cash. Accordingly, we cannot presently determine the amount that ultimately will be paid to former holders of Fibrek shares in connection with the proceedings, but we have accrued approximately Cdn $14 million ( $11 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ) for the eventual payment of those claims. The hearing in this matter is expected to begin in 2019. On June 12, 2012, we filed a motion for directives with the Quebec Superior Court, the Canadian court with jurisdiction in the creditor protection proceedings from which AbitibiBowater Inc. (our predecessor entity) and all but one of its affiliates emerged in 2010 (the Creditor Protection Proceedings), seeking an order to prevent pension regulators in each of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador from declaring partial wind-ups of pension plans relating to employees of former operations in New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, or a declaration that any claim for accelerated reimbursements of deficits arising from a partial wind-up is a barred claim under the Creditor Protection Proceedings. These plans are subject to the funding relief regulations described in Note 13, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans - Canadian pension funding, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and we contend, among other things, that any such declaration, if issued, would be inconsistent with the Quebec Superior Courts sanction order confirming the plan of reorganization and the terms of our emergence from the Creditor Protection Proceedings. A partial wind-up would likely shorten the period in which any deficit within those plans, which could reach up to Cdn $150 million ( $115 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ), would have to be funded if we do not obtain the relief sought. No hearing date has been set to date. Environmental matters We are subject to a variety of federal or national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental regulations promulgated in the future could require substantial additional expenditures for compliance and could have a material impact on us, in particular, and the industry in general. We may be a potentially responsible party with respect to four hazardous waste sites that are being addressed pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act corrective action authority. We believe we will not be liable for any significant amounts at any of these sites. We have recorded $9 million and $12 million of environmental liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, primarily related to environmental remediation related to closed sites. The amount of these liabilities represents managements estimate of the ultimate settlement based on an assessment of relevant factors and assumptions and could be affected by changes in facts or assumptions not currently known to management for which the outcome cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. These liabilities are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have also recorded $22 million and $23 million of asset retirement obligations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, primarily consisting of liabilities associated with landfills, sludge basins and the dismantling of retired assets. These liabilities are included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other matters On October 30, 2014, we received a notice from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry of Ontario (the MNRF) directing us to repay a conditional incentive of Cdn $23 million ( $18 million , based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016 ) offered in 2007 toward the construction of an electricity-producing turbine, should we fail to restart our Fort Frances, Ontario, pulp and paper mill or otherwise implement an alternative remedy that is acceptable to the MNRF. Several extensions to implement an alternative remedy have been granted to us by the MNRF, with the latest remedy date being January 2, 2017. We announced the permanent closure of the mill in the second quarter of 2014 and have been exploring a number of opportunities for the mill. We are not presently able to determine the outcome of this process, but we currently believe that we could reach an acceptable outcome for the MNRF. Accordingly, we have recorded no contingent liability in respect of this notice in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 .\n",

      "Segment Information Note 13. Segment Information We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Accordingly, our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. None of the income or loss items following Operating income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations are allocated to our segments, since those items are reviewed separately by management. For the same reason, closure costs, impairment and other related charges, inventory write-downs related to closures, start-up costs, gains and losses on disposition of assets, certain components of pension and OPEB costs and credits as well as other discretionary charges or credits are not allocated to our segments. We allocate depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although the related fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are not allocated to segment assets. Additionally, all selling, general and administrative expenses are allocated to our segments, with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under corporate and other. Information about certain segment data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 , was as follows: (Unaudited, in millions) Market Pulp (1) Tissue Wood Products (2) Newsprint Specialty Papers Segment Total Corporate and Other Total Sales Third quarter 2016 $ 198 $ 23 $ 168 $ 242 $ 257 $ 888 $ $ 888 2015 230 131 258 286 905 905 First nine months 2016 619 70 432 756 779 2,656 2,656 2015 679 404 838 830 2,751 2,751 Depreciation and amortization (3) Third quarter 2016 $ 10 $ 2 $ 7 $ 17 $ 11 $ 47 $ 4 $ 51 2015 14 9 16 18 57 2 59 First nine months 2016 28 6 23 56 34 147 10 157 2015 40 26 48 54 168 8 176 Operating income (loss) Third quarter 2016 $ 5 $ (5 ) $ 36 $ (8 ) $ (2 ) $ 26 $ (16 ) $ 10 2015 22 9 (10 ) 9 30 (24 ) 6 First nine months 2016 37 (11 ) 52 (16 ) 21 83 (91 ) (8 ) 2015 59 10 (10 ) 31 90 (83 ) 7 (1) Market pulp sales excluded inter-segment sales of $11 million and $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $26 million and $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are transacted at cost.

      "Change in accounting estimate We periodically review the estimated economic useful lives of our fixed assets. Based on this review, during the first quarter of 2016, we prospectively changed our estimate of the useful lives of certain of our machinery and equipment to reflect a net increase of estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment were changed to a range of five to 25 years , increasing the weighted-average estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment by two years . The effect of this change in estimate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was to reduce Depreciation and amortization, and increase Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. , and basic and diluted Net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. common shareholders in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows: (Unaudited, in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Depreciation and amortization $ 3 $ 9 Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 2 5 Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 (Unaudited, in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Depreciation and amortization $ 3 $ 9 Net income (loss) attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 2 5 Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Resolute Forest Products Inc. 0.02 0.06 \n",

      "New accounting pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective or prospective basis as required for each amendment. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, respectively, which further affect the guidance of ASU 2014-09. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces the current expected credit losses model in the estimation of credit losses on financial instruments. This update is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. All amendments to the guidance shall be adopted in the same period on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance will not materially impact the presentation of our cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory until the transferred assets are sold to a third party or recovered through use. This update is effective on a modified retrospective approach for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period, we plan to adopt this ASU as of January 1, 2017, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to Deficit in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. The adoption of this accounting guidance will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n",
